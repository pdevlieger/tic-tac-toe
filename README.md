#Tic Tac Toe games
- - -

This is just a collection of two tic tac toe games I wrote while I was in Hacker School. The code "tic-tac-toe.py" is very rudimentary and was one of my first (non-statistical) coding experiences. While the quality of the code is not really great, I left it on to see where I am coming from. The code to "TTT_AI.py" is more advanced in how the game is processed and also features a minimax AI.

## possible future upgrades

I could possibly use pygame to make the player interaction nicer to look at.
